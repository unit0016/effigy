  - bugfix: Attempting to latejoin via cryo while no cryopods exist will no longer
      destroy you with hammers.

  - balance: Rimpoint has been adjusted slightly. Most lake and ocean water is now
      deep water, and will drown you after some trudging. Atmospherics has received
      a proper project space on the roof, cordoned off from maintenance - and maintenance
      has consequently shifted to be directly against the Captain's office. Sad!
